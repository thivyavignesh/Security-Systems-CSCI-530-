Literature Survey on modern Intrusion Detection Systems based on SDN and Honeypot - as a part of the coursework of CSCI 530 Security Systems

## Abstract

In the cyberspace, the capabilities of an adversary, to find and exploit a system vulnerability to perform malicious actions, increase in proportion to the rising scale of computational
and technological advancement. In correspondence, the defense mechanisms against such actions should also be revised and updated to either gain the upper hand or maintain a balance
between the attack and defense. One such defense mechanism which plays an active role in detecting anomalous presence through periodic audits or behavioral analysis is commonly
referred to as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

In this survey, I plan to briefly elucidate the concept of Intrusion detection system and discuss the functionalities of some modern IDS exclusively focusing on IDS implementations on
SDN architectures and IDS implementations using Honeypot technology.
